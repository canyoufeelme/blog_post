      <h3> How people use the cameras on cellphones to capture various things around the world and how efficient is. Knowing where you are. How well GPS can track every one of your movements and the extent to how invasive they can actually be.	Connecting the dots	How things especially emails and the internet are interconnected. </h3>

      <h3>I geniunely found this article interesting. It's crazy to think where humans can take this technology, it seems like it's really only to get more invasive than it already is</h3>

  <h5>It's insane how much technology has improved in the last couple decades. I can't even comprehend what technology will be like even 20 years from now. Soon things we could only imagine will come into reality. It's really hard to keep anything private, because we keep almost evrything on our phones and other devices. </h5>

      <h3>The main idea of this video was how Human Technology has made our lives more effecient and really where it's going to go from here. It talks about how overtime we've developed AI and various "Robots" so to speak and how those tools have helped us with various tasks. It also roughly touches on the integration of automation into economics. It generally touches on how less and less human labor will be apparent. The video states that in the near future 45% of the human workforce could soon be replaced by bots.</h3>
